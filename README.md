# React Native - A Preparedness Experiment

The purpose of this project is to start getting familiar with React Native. I'm coming into it with only a knowledge of React as an MVC for web browsers. This Readme will serve as a note taking area as well as a step by step through the process. 

## Getting started

First I installed the CLI tools I needed with: 

`npm i -g create-react-native-app`

With that tool ready, I can start this project: 

`create-react-native-app DishConditioning`
